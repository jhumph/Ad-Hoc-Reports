-- 1. How many Toastmasters events are there using LetsMeet in New York, Chicago and San Francisco?
/*

- There are 986 Toastmasters events in Chicago, 124 in New York, and 7 in San Francisco
*/

-- 2. Is LetsMeet membership leveling off?
/*
- Membership growth has grown almost exponentially throughout the years from 4 members in 2003 to over 10,000 in 2017. 
- The largest increase in members occured in 2015 at 118%. Membership growth seems to begin to dwindle at this point. 2017 appears to have the smallest percent of increase at about 3.5%. 
- Upon further investigation of 2017, it seems as though there are some discrepancies in the data. Growth in the year of 2017 was as expected until the month of August. Membership began to decline. This is especially apparent in November and December. There were only 223 and 12 new memberships, repesctively. 
-  This decline in membership growth could be due errors in data collection such as incorrect dates or missing dates from the data. Further investigation shows that Chicago actually saw a decrease in members in 2017. 
- Membership could be leveling off due to a number of reasons concerning the data, but it could also deal with the types of groups offered at the time of year or low referral rates.
